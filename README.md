# Enterprise Tech 101

## Overview 

- What we've been seeing from Enterprise clients
- Three core areas clients need tech training in: 
  - **Building** solutions (client projects, maintainable, best practices)
  - **Delivering** solutions (delivering value quickly, disaster recovery, quick iterations)
  - **Hosting** solutions (scalable, performant, secure, maintainable environment)
